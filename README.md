The backend of this project is built with Node.js and Express, providing a robust and scalable server-side solution for managing data and handling business logic. The backend integrates with MongoDB for data storage and includes RESTful API endpoints for communication with the frontend.

Key Features
API Endpoints: RESTful APIs to handle various operations including:

User Management: Endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting user information.
Slot Management: Endpoints for managing availability slots, including CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Session Scheduling: Endpoints to schedule, view, update, and delete sessions.
Data Storage: Utilizes MongoDB to store and manage data related to users, availability slots, and sessions.

Error Handling: Implements error handling for different types of errors, including validation errors and server errors.

Validation: Basic validation for required fields and data integrity.

Technologies Used
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for building the server-side application.
Express: Web framework for building RESTful APIs and managing routing.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing and retrieving application data.
Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, providing a schema-based solution to model data.
Project Structure
src/routes/: Contains route definitions for various API endpoints.

/users: Routes for user management (e.g., registration, login, user data retrieval).
/slots: Routes for managing availability slots (e.g., create, update, delete slots).
/sessions: Routes for scheduling and managing sessions.
src/models/: Defines Mongoose schemas and models for MongoDB collections.

User.ts: Schema for user data.
Slot.ts: Schema for availability slots.
Session.ts: Schema for session data.
src/controllers/: Contains business logic for handling requests and interacting with the database.

src/middleware/: Includes middleware functions for request validation, authentication, and error handling.

src/config/: Configuration files for environment variables, database connections, and other settings.
